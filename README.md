# spring_exercices
Test Spring Projects for learning
This is a project to play with spring boot and its different features.

Up to now there are three exercices:

1. http://localhost:8124/greeting - The controller returns the typical "hello World" using mustache to bind name variable to the html
2. http://localhost:8124/formulario.html - The html form sends three fields to the controller and it manages, with the help of mustache, to return a html with same fields.
3. http://localhost:8124/formulario_urls.html - The controller returns a number related to the url that was selected in the page
